# Sorting directories

```{r setup_3, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(fs)
library(here)
```

To prove skills in the field off Guerilla Analytics folder structure, a previously unstructured file (named Daur2) has been re-sorted according to the Guerilla analytics principles. To showcase the file structure, the fs package command dir_tree will be performed

__Organised directory tree__
````{r DirTree_Organized}
fs::dir_tree(path = here("Daur2_Organisation_2.1/Daur2_Organized/"), type = "directory")

````

__Original directory tree__
````{r DirTree_Original}
fs::dir_tree(path = here("Daur2_Organisation_2.1/Daur2_Original/"), type = "directory")
````
