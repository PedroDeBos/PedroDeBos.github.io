In this RMD, a excel data sheet supplied by J. louter (INT/ILC), derrived from a experiment in which adult C.elegans were exposed to varying concentrations of different compounds. In this RMD, a dose-response curve shall be created.

First off, the data stored in an excel file shall be read
````{r reading_excelData}
# CREATE A PROPER TABLE TO SHOWCASE THIS DATA, AND THE FINAL TIDY DATA
excel_location<-here("data.raw/CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx")
Celegans_data_raw<-read_excel(excel_location, sheet = 1)
````

After reading in the data, it's transformed in order to be able to create proper figures from it. For this, the important data columns.
expType: The type of experiment (Experimental, control)

RawData: Ammount of ofspring Celegans gave after 68 hours of exposure to the treatment

compName: The compound to which the Celegans was exposed to.

compConcentration: The concentration of the compound which the Celegans was exposed to.

````{r tidying_Excel}
#Dataset inspection and transformation

#Selecting data for this goal
Celegans_data_select<-Celegans_data_raw %>% dplyr::select(expType, compName, RawData, compConcentration)

#Datapoint 259 has a comma instead of a point. Transforming value via str_replace
Celegans_data_select$compConcentration<-Celegans_data_select$compConcentration %>% str_replace(",", ".")

#Now properly transforming the compConcentration data into numeric
Celegans_data_select$compConcentration<-Celegans_data_select$compConcentration %>% as.numeric()

#Transforming expType and compName into a factor variable

levels_exptype<-unique(Celegans_data_select$expType) #storing all exptype levels
Celegans_data_select$expType<-factor(Celegans_data_select$expType, levels = levels_exptype) #Transforming exptype
levels_compname<-unique(Celegans_data_select$compName) #Storing all compName levels
Celegans_data_select$compName<-factor(Celegans_data_select$compName, levels = levels_compname) #Transforming compName into factor

#Re-loading the
Celegans_data<-Celegans_data_select

#Checking if transformation went properly
Celegans_data
````

After tidying the data from the excel file, exploritary graphs have been created to study the data more thouroughly

````{r dataplots}
Celegans_data %>% ggplot(aes(x=log10(compConcentration+0.00005), y=RawData))+ #Added 0.0005 as otherwise, due to using log10, the S-medium values which are = 0, would be deleted.
  geom_jitter(aes(colour=compName, shape=expType), width = 0.05)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title="Effect of multiple treatments on offspring production by C.elegans",
    x="log 10 treatment concentration (nM)",
    y="Amount of offspring",
    colour="Treatment",
    shape="Experiment type"
  )
  
````

To properly be able to study the effect of the different treatments on C.elegans, the data will be normalised for the negative control S-medium.

````{r normalisingDataForNegativeControl}
#Determine the mean of the negative control
negctrl_mean<-Celegans_data_select$RawData[Celegans_data_select$expType=="controlNegative"] %>% mean()

#Normalising the data
Celegans_data_select_normalised<-Celegans_data_select %>% mutate(
  normalised_RawData=RawData/negctrl_mean
)

#Plotting the normalised data
Celegans_data_select_normalised %>% ggplot(aes(x=log10(compConcentration+0.00005), y=normalised_RawData))+
  geom_jitter(aes(colour=compName, shape=expType), width = 0.05)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title="Normalised effect of multiple treatments on offspring production by C.elegans",
    x="log 10 treatment concentration (nM)",
    y="Normalised amount of offspring",
    colour="Treatment",
    shape="Experiment type"
  )

````

For a clearer picture of the correlations, a summarise version of the graph has also been made:
````{r ClearerGraph, message=FALSE}
#Creating a summarised version of the data based on Treatment and concentration
Celegans_data_normalised_sum<-Celegans_data_select_normalised %>% group_by(compConcentration, compName) %>% summarise(
  mean_normalised=mean(normalised_RawData)
)

#Filtering out S-medium, as that is the negative control.
Celegans_data_normalised_sum<-Celegans_data_normalised_sum %>% filter(!compName=="S-medium")

#Plotting the summarised data.
Celegans_data_normalised_sum %>% ggplot(aes(x=log10(compConcentration+0.00005), y=mean_normalised))+
  geom_point(aes(colour=compName), size=3)+
  geom_line(aes(colour=compName))+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title="Normalised effect of multiple treatments on offspring production by C.elegans",
    x="log 10 treatment concentration (nM)",
    y="Normalised amount of offspring",
    colour="Treatment"
  )
