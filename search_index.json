In this RMD, a dose-response curve shall be created. First off, the data stored in an excel file shall be read # CREATE A PROPER TABLE TO SHOWCASE THIS DATA, AND THE FINAL TIDY DATA excel_location&lt;-here(&quot;data.raw/CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx&quot;) Celegans_data_raw&lt;-read_excel(excel_location, sheet = 1) datatable(Celegans_data_raw, options = list( scrollX=TRUE )) After reading in the data, its transformed in order to be able to create proper figures from it. For this, the important data columns. expType: The type of experiment (Experimental, control) RawData: Ammount of ofspring Celegans gave after 68 hours of exposure to the treatment compName: The compound to which the Celegans was exposed to. compConcentration: The concentration of the compound which the Celegans was exposed to. #Dataset inspection and transformation #Selecting data for this goal Celegans_data_select&lt;-Celegans_data_raw %&gt;% dplyr::select(expType, compName, RawData, compConcentration) #Datapoint 259 has a comma instead of a point.

You can override using the `.groups` argument. #Filtering out S-medium, as that is the negative control. Celegans_data_normalised_sum&lt;-Celegans_data_normalised_sum %&gt;% filter(!compName==&quot;S-medium&quot;) #Plotting the summarised data. Celegans_data_normalised_sum %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=log10(compConcentration+0.00005), y=mean_normalised))+ geom_point(aes(colour=compName), size=3)+ geom_line(aes(colour=compName))+ theme_bw()+ labs( title=&quot;Normalised effect of multiple treatments on offspring production by C.elegans&quot;, x=&quot;log 10 treatment concentration (nM)&quot;, y=&quot;Normalised amount of offspring (%)&quot;, colour=&quot;Treatment&quot; ) Based on these exploratory graphs, we can conclude that 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene, decane and nephthalene all cause a decrease in the ammount of offspring generated by C.elegans. Decane only appears to decrease offspring at higher concentrations, 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene seems to cause a relatively constant decrease in offspring at increasing concentrations, and nephthalene seems to stagnate untill extremely high concentrations are used. Based on this data, a LC-50 analysis could be performed.

"],["plan-for-future.html", "5 Plan for future", " 5 Plan for future In this RMD file, my plans for the future skill I want to learn will be layed out. During DSFB2, 4 days (32 hours) have been given as free time, to perform our own research and practice into learning a new workflow/skill. As my goal is to go into data sciences within microbiology, one way to spend this time is to learn further workflows within bacterial research. For example, There is more depth to be found in the identification of bacterial colonies by computers: https://towardsdatascience.com/recognition-and-counting-of-microorganisms-on-petri-dishes-53a499283dc8 Furthermore, I could also use this time to further study further workflows in microbiome research, and study what workflows are used when studying the microbiome.https://builtin.com/data-science/microbiome-research-data-science Lastly, I could also spent this time starting my learning journey in Python. With this, I could both study automisation and, perhaps more importantly, start on studying how machine learning works. https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter13/ "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
